        "bio":"As a tech enthusiast, new technologies has always fascinated me. Belonging to a non technical background, it was hard for me to get any idea that how I should start my technical journey. Then after joining GDG I learnt about new technologies and now I have good experience with Firebase, web development and also on Cloud. I have also made application on Google Assistance. I have managed many events with my team like DevFest, IWD, Tensorflow DevSummit and many more. Managing these events developed my interpersonal skills and made me help my community more and more. I like to take sessions on different technologies so that I can make my community well aware about the same. Whether its about using cloud APIs of creating a Firebase login form on web, I love to deliver sessions on different technologies. In my free time, i like to explore new technologies and sometimes exploring new places.",
